          <p className="py-2 text-[#878883]">
            I hold dual M.S. Degrees in Information Technology and have spent
            the last 20 years in the IT Field working as a professional
            enterprise engineer and working in other various IT positions. I
            have always had a passion for development, especially the creativity
            aspect and its final result. In 2019 Covid changed the world, and I
            utilized this time to submerse myself into fine tunning my HTML &
            CSS skills in order to use them within my startup business. In
            actuality the fine tuning has now become a new found passion and
            love for Fullstack development.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-[#878883]">
            Captivated by the unbounded creativity programming allow you to
            implement, I was instantly attracted and wanted to learn more. I
            started taking courses and building on previously acquired knowledge
            by learning javascript and was even more fascinated with developing
            websites interactive. I currently started to do freelancing with a
            focus on Fullstack, Blockchain and mobile development applications.
            I am now spending my time building projects with Next JS, React JS,
            Firebase, and am constantly learning new technologies.
